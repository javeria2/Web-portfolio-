# Web portfolio for CS242

- Showcase of all the projects worked upon till now by parsing svn xml files using MongoDB for the databse, node.js and express.js for the server and mocha and chai for unit testing. 
- See it in action [here](https://cs242webportfolio.herokuapp.com).

### Installation
Download the source folder, navigate into the folder directory and type in: ```npm install``` on the command line, npm will install all the dependencies by looking into the ```package.json``` file. Then type in ```node app.js``` to start the server.
If you prefer nodemon instead (like me), type in ```nodemon app.js```

### Todos
