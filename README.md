# Web portfolio for CS242

- Showcase of all the projects worked upon till now by parsing svn xml files using MongoDB for the databse, node.js and express.js for the server and mocha for unit testing. 

### Installation
Download the source folder, navigate into the folder directory and type in: ```npm install``` npm will install all the dependencies by looking into the ```package.json``` file. Then type in ```node app.js``` to start the server.
If you prefer nodemon instead (like me), type in ```nodemon app.js```
